Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My focus is on GCP, K8 and Go. Some Terraform as applicable. My pinned repos are for the tech I am actively working on upskilling, creating and levelling up in. Please see the applicable readme.md files for details. 

I am currently preparing to start several projects that align with obtaining the GCP CDL, KCNA,GCP ACE, CKA and GCP DevOps Engineer certs, along with a deep dive into levelling up in Go. I hope to have all of these completed by Q3 of 2026. 

I am currently in the process of organizing the existing repos to have a more logical flow to each. Additionally, going forward, all work done will be following the same consistant format: Project_Services_Date_Description_ Task Description.
