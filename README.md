Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My focus is on GCP, K8 and Go. Some Terraform as applicable. My pinned repos are for the tech I am actively working on upskilling, creating and leveling up in. Please see the applicable readme.md files for details, screencaptures and specifics. 

As I have been working through the Udacity GCP Fundamentals course I am finishing up, I have enjoyed the labs and learning, especially using GKE and Kubernetes, more then any tech I have touched recently. The level of engagement and intrest I have enjoyed while working through this course has inspired me to go all in on the following technologies for my career going forward: GCP, Kubernetes, SQL and Go - Specifically for a Principal Cloud Architect or Staff Platform Engineering role.

As such, I am seetting a highly ambitious goal for myself to level up my career more then ever before. I am going to obtain the below certifications, complete every single lab - proving hand-on proficiency and subject matter expertise through professionally well documented repos, in the following timeframe. One of the reasons I am calling this timeline out is this sets specific chronological deadlines I would like to adhere to, which increases the liklihood of completing these goals within the timeframe I would like. I look forward to this next year, and the technical skill advancement that will come from obtaining the following:

- GCP Cloud Digital Leader | Time to Complete: 7H15M - (1) Month | Deliverable Date: 08312025
- Go Advanced Proficiency/Produce well documented and production ready code: | Time to Complete: (2) Months | Deliverable Date: 10312025
- KCNA | Time to Complete: (1) Month | Deliverable Date: 11302025
- SQL | Time to Complete: 42H - (3) Months | Deliverable Date: 02282025
- GCP ACE | Time to Complete: (6) Months | Deliverable Date: 08312026
