I will be maintaining and expanding this as time allows, for professional projects I have completed, and projects that I will be starting. Some will be on-going based on ideas that I have, and will continue to grow as I test and develop them. They will be encompassing the following tech stack:

- Python (And Flask - Ongoing)
- Kubernetes (On-going)(On-prem & big three cloud)
- Pytorch (On-going)
- GCP
- ArgoCD
- Promethius
- Jenkins
- Ansible
- Terraform

I greatly enjoy learning and always expanding my skills, so this list may expand over time. At this time I am currently pursuing my next oppertunity, specifically as a DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, Senior Systems Engineer or a Senior Site Reliability Engineer, so the projects I have been working on and am planning on starting in the near term will be in support of those four roles. Thank you for visiting my GitHub, and please feel free to follow and check back often as I have multiple projects I look forward to working and sharing. 

If you are looking for a dynamic, versatile engineer for one of these four roles with deep technical knowhow in a variaty of industries, who is constantly levelling up their skillset, is able to hit the ground running with minimal ramp-up time, who can seemlesly context switch between independent and collaborative cross-functional environments and who is genuinly passionate about technology, root-cause analysis and operational excellance, I would love to talk with you about what challenges you may be dealing with and how I could contribute to solving them.
