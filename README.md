Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My focus is on GCP, K8 and Python (Infra and AI Production Code and Scripting). Some Terraform, Puppet, Grafana, SQL, and of course, keeping up with any changes in the RHEL space. My pinned repos are for the tech I am actively working on upskilling and maintaining, building in, and leveling up. Please see the applicable readme.md files for details, screencaptures and any other applicable specifics. I will be keeping my LinkedIn updated with my progress towards these goals, along with hands-on done here on my GitHub. 

As I have been working through the Udacity GCP Fundamentals course I am finishing up, I have enjoyed the labs and learning, especially using GKE and Kubernetes, more then any tech I have touched recently. The level of engagement and intrest I have enjoyed while working through this course has inspired me to go all in on the above technologies for this next stage in my my career going forward - Specifically for either a Staff Platform or ML DevOps engineering role.

As such, I am setting a more ambitious goal for myself to level up my career more then I ever have in the past before. I am going to obtain the below certifications, and complete the following courses - proving hand-on proficiency and subject matter expertise through professionally well documented repos, in the following timeframe, as the below align with everything else time responsibility wise I have in my life. One of the reasons I am calling this timeline out is this sets specific chronological deadlines I would like to adhere to, which increases the liklihood of completing these goals within the timeframe I have set. I look forward to the next two years, and the technical advancement that will come from obtaining the following:
