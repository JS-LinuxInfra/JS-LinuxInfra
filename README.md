This is my GitHub I will be maintaining as time allows, both for projects I have completed, and projects that I will be starting. Most will be not very lengthy, but some will be on-going based on some ideas I have, and will continue to grow as I test ideas I have and confirm they work. They will be encompassing Python (And Flask - Ongoing), AWS, Kubernetes (On-going), Docker, ArgoCD, Datadog, Promethius, Linux, Jenkins, Tensorflow (On-going), Ansible, Terraform and anything else I start digging into. I love learning, K8, containers, and both writing and debuggingcode, so I will be building this out as time allows going forward. Thanks for checking this out, and come back regularly as I will be as active as I am able to, and will be growing things as I am able to.
