Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My current and ongoing focus is on developing expertise and proficiency in GCP, Python and AI development/support. Please see the applicable readme.md files of each repo for details, screen captures and any other applicable specifics. While working through the current GCP course I am going through, I have enjoyed the hands on and leveling up more then any technology I have worked with over the course of my career, which is what has inspired the below career and subject matter expertise aspirations.
