Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My focus is on GCP, K8 and Go. Some Terraform as applicable. My pinned repos are for the tech I am actively working on upskilling, creating and levelling up in. Please see the applicable readme.md files for details, screencaptures and specifics. 

My list of projects and certs that I am starting in August of 2025 includes the following. I do not intend on taking breaks in between ,as I would like to obtain each of the following certifications over the next 12 months, while maintaining and updating the applicable repo screenshots of all building,troubleshooting and projects completed.

- GCP Cloud Digital Leader 
- KCNA 
- GCP ACE 
- CKA 
- GCP PDOE 

This is in addition to maintaining my current certifications:

- CCNA 
- Security+, CE
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals
- Terraform Associate
- AWS CCP

Remaining To-Do for GitHub prior to starting the above skill track:
1. Create folders by task and service for all screen captures, move all images and update pointers, confirm everything looks good
2. Create Go Repo
3. Make Linked Post sharing new project/goal and hashtag GCP, K8, Go
4. Finish Udacity GCP course - upload and annotate all
