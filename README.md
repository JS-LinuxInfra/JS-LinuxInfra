Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My focus is on developing expertise and proficiency in both K8 and Python along with GCP and Python in the AI space. While I do not intend on going forward in the cloud engineering space outside of maintaining all three cloud fundamentalcerts, I am certainly open to a conversation pertaining to that if the oppertunity arose. Until then, or unless that occurs, I intend on focusing on mastery of K8 and Python. Please see the applicable readme.md files of each repo for details, screen captures and any other applicable specifics. I will be keeping my LinkedIn updated with my progress towards these goals, along with hands-on done here on my GitHub. As such, I am setting a highly ambitious goal for myself to level up my career more then I ever have in the past before, with the following certifications and courses.
