I will be maintaining and expanding this as time allows, for professional projects I have completed, and projects that I will be starting. Some will be on-going based on ideas that I have, and will continue to grow as I test and develop them. They will be encompassing the following tech stack:

- Python (And Flask - Ongoing)
- Kubernetes (On-going)
- Pytorch (On-going)
- AWS
- GCP
- Docker
- ArgoCD
- Datadog
- Promethius
- Linux
- Jenkins
- Ansible
- Terraform

I greatly enjoy learning and always expanding my skills, so this list may expand over time. At this time I am currently pursuing my next oppertunity, specifically as a DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, Senior Systems Engineer or a Senior Site Reliability Engineer, so the projects I have been working on and am planning on starting in the near term will be in support of those four roles. Thank you for visiting my GitHub, and please feel free to follow and check back often as I have multiple projects I look forward to working and sharing.
