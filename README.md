Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My focus is on GCP, K8 and Go. Some Terraform as applicable. My pinned repos are for the tech I am actively working on upskilling, creating and levelling up in. Please see the applicable readme.md files for details, screencaptures and specifics. 

As I have been working through the Udacity GCP Fundamentals course I am finishing up, I have enjoyed the labs and learning, especially using GKE and Kubernetes, more then any tech I have touched recently. The level of engagement and intrest I have enjoyed while working through this course has inspired me to go all in on the following technologies for my career going forward: GCP, Kubernetes, and Go - Specifically for Cloud DevSecOps or Platform Engineering roles.

As such, I am seetting a highly ambitious goal for myself to level up my career more then ever before. I am going to obtain the below certifications, complete every single lab - proving hand-on proficiency and subject matter expertise through professionally well documented repos, in the following timeframe. One of the reasons I am calling this timeline out is this sets specific chronological deadlines I would like to adhere to, which increases the liklihood of completing these goals within the timeframe I would like. I look forward to this next year, and the technical skill advancement that will come from obtaining the following:

- GCP Cloud Digital Leader | Time to Complete: (1) Month | Deliverable Date: 08312025
- KCNA | Time to Complete: (1) Month | Deliverable Date: 09302025
- GCP ACE | Time to Complete: (2) Months | Deliverable Date: 11302025
- Go Advanced Proficiency/Produce well documented and production ready code: | Time to Complete: (2) Months | Deliverable Date: 01312026
- CKA + Advanced K8 administration topics: | Time to Complete: (3) Months | Deliverable Date: 04302026
- CKS: | Time to Complete: (2) Months | Deliverable Date: 06302026
- GCP PDOE: | Time to Complete: (2) Months | Deliverable Date: 08312026

This is in addition to maintaining my current certifications:

- CCNA 
- Security+, CE
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals
- Terraform Associate
- AWS CCP

Remaining To-Do for GitHub prior to starting the above skill track:
1. Create folders by task and service for all screen captures, move all images and update pointers, confirm everything looks good
2. Create Go Repo
3. Fix K8 screenshot
4. Finish Udacity GCP course 
5. Make Linked Post sharing new course and project/goals; hashtag GCP, K8, Go
