Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My focus is on developing expertise and proficiency in GCP and Python. Please see the applicable readme.md files of each repo for details, screen captures and any other applicable specifics. While working through the current GCP course I am going through, I have enjoyed the hands on and levveling up more then any technology I have worked with over the course of my career, which is what has inspired the below aspirations.
