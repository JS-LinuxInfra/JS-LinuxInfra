# About Me

Platform Engineer specializing in Kubernetes, GCP, Terraform and cloud-native infrastructure. Thank you for visiting my GitHub!

My career thus far has been focused on specializing in Linux (RHEL/Ubuntu), Virtualization (VMWare & KVM), and Networking (Layers 2 & 3). I have progressively moved from :

- Helpdesk
- Enterprise Operational Server Support/Administration
- Network Engineering
- Senior System Administration
- Infrastructure Engineering

I currently reside in the Seattle metro area and absolutely love it here.

**Ideal roles:** SRE or Platform Engineer.

**Primary technological focus:** Kubernetes, Go, GCP, Prometheus, Rook, GitOps, Backstage, Istio, Cilium.

I am active on here and LinkedIn almost daily, as I am passionate about working in both GCP and with cloud native technologies. It's not work if you enjoy what you do, right?

I run all my own labs locally - building, breaking, troubleshooting, root cause analysis and documentation. All projects follow structured, methodical documentation to ensure clarity and reproducibility.

Thank you again for visiting my GitHub, and if any of this resonates with you, or you have any questions, I would love to connect and speak further, so please do not hesitate to reach out, either here, on LinkedIn, or via email.
