This is my GitHub I will be maintaining as time allows going forward, both for projects I have completed, and projects I will be starting. Most will be not very lengthy, but some will be on-going based on some ideas I have. They will be encompassing Python (And Flask - Ongoing), AWS, Kubernetes (On-going), Docker, Jenkins, Tensorflow (On-going), Ansible, Terraform and anything else I start digging into. I love upskilling, K8, containers, and writing code, so I will be building this out as time allows going forward. Thanks for checking this out, and come back regularly as I will be as active as I am able to.
