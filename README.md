Thank you for visiting my GitHub. My focus is on developing expertise and proficiency in both K8, Terraform and Python. Some Puppet, Grafana, and of course, keeping up with any changes in the RHEL space. While I do not intend on going forward in the cloud engineering space outside of maintaining all three cloud fundamentalcerts, I am certainly open to a conversation pertaining to that if the oppertunity arose. Until then, or unless that occurs, I intend on focusing on mastery of K8 and Python. Please see the applicable readme.md files of each repo for details, screen captures and any other applicable specifics. I will be keeping my LinkedIn updated with my progress towards these goals, along with hands-on done here on my GitHub. 

As I have been working through the Udacity GCP Fundamentals course I am finishing up, I have enjoyed the labs and learning, especially using GKE and Kubernetes, more then any tech I have touched recently. The level of engagement and intrest I have enjoyed while working through this course has inspired me to go all in on the above technologies for this next stage in my my career going forward - Specifically for either a Staff Platform engineering role.

As such, I am setting a more ambitious goal for myself to level up my career more then I ever have in the past before. I am going to obtain the below certifications, and complete the following courses - proving hand-on proficiency and subject matter expertise through professionally well documented repos and code, in the following timeframe, as the below align with everything else time wise that I have going in my life. One of the reasons I am calling this timeline out is this sets specific chronological deadlines I will  strive to adhere to, which increases the liklihood of completing these goals in the desired timeframe.
