# About Me

Thank you for visiting my GitHub and I hope your day is going well.

My career thus far has been focused on specializing in Linux (RHEL/Ubuntu), Virtualization (VMWare & KVM), and Networking (Layers 2 & 3). I have progressively moved from :

- Helpdesk
- Enterprise Operational Server Support/Administration
- Network Engineering
- Senior System Administration
- Infrastructure Engineering

I currently reside in the Seattle metro area and absolutely love it here.

**Ideal roles:** SRE, Platform Engineer, or Cloud DevOps Engineer, L4 level.

**Primary technological focus:** Kubernetes, Go, GCP, Prometheus, GitHub Actions, Backstage, ArgoCD, Istio, Cilium

I am active on here and LinkedIn almost daily, as I am passionate about working in both GCP and with cloud native technologies. It's not work if you enjoy what you do, right?

Please note, I run all my own labs locally in my own environment. I prefer this as not only do I have to set them up myself, but when I break them, I have to fix them. 

Additionally, I am a huge proponent of organized, methodical documentation, and strive to have each and every repo I work in and build adhere to this standard.

Thank you again for visiting my GitHub, and if any of this resonates with you, or you have any questions, I would love to connect and speak further, so please do not hesitate to reach out, either here, on LinkedIn, or via email.

### Notes
Earlier commits were not annotated due to a focus on uploading and documenting work completed while repos were being built. Additionally, I had not yet developed consistent formatting across my various repos. 
Going forward, as of 08/20/2025, in addition to consistent documentation formatting and tree structure, all commits will be annotated with what is being uploaded.

Below is a roadmap of planned certifications, courses, and projects I am or will be working on. I try to devote 10-15 hours a week to this so ideally this will all be completed in the next 15 months.
