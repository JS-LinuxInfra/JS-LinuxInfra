# About Me

Thank you for visiting my GitHub.  

My current and ongoing focus for this next stage of my career is developing expertise and proficiency primarily in **Kubernetes, Prometheus, GitHub Actions, GKE, AKS, ArgoCD, Backstage, Go, Istio, and Cilium**. Please see the respective `README.md` files in each repository for details, screen captures, and other specifics.

Pinned repositories represent the **tech stack I am actively working on and preparing for the applicable certifications**. My next career step is in a **Platform Engineering role**, with the ultimate aspiration of **Staff or Principal Engineer in Seattle**, as I am not interested in relocating. As I complete each of the below goals, I will remove from the below list, and my LinkedIn will be updated as applicable.

If anything you see here is of interest and you would like to connect or discuss, I would love to speak with you.
